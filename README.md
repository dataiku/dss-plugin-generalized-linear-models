# Generalized Linear Model Plugin
The GLM plugin allows users to implement generalized linear model functionality within DSS visual machine learning.
Binary Classification and Regression are available but multiclass is not. The models use the same logic as the 
[statsmodels library](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/glm.html). Please note this plugin is still in development 
and its accuracy therefore is not able to be guaranteed.
