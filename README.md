# Generalized Linear Model Plugin
The GLM plugin allows users to implement generalized linear model functionality within DSS visual machine learning.
Binary Classification and Regression are available but multiclass is not. The models use the same logic as the 
[statsmodels library](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/glm.html).
